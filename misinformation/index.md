Drivechain is a strict improvement - it benefits all Bitcoiners and has no downsides.

Nonetheless, it has many enemies:

* Altcoiners (who want their alt investment to do well).
* The Anti-Alt Bitcoin Immune System (which is misfiring in this case).
* Rival L2s (who prioritize their equity/prestige, over Bitcoin's success).
* People who are publicly known to be DC-haters, and who will now be humiliated if it succeeds.

Here are some of the misconceptions which they spread:

### 1. Drivechains Bring "Sh&!coins To Bitcoin" 🤡

Some projects ---Colored Coins (2012), Omni (2014), Counterparty (2014), Taro (2022), BRC20 (2023), Runes (2023)--- enable "Sh&!coins", on any Blockchain, including Bitcoin.

But Drivechain is not one of them. Drivechain does *nothing whatsoever* to further enable Altcoins on Bitcoin.

In fact, Drivechain builds you a new blockchain *without* a new coin. This *eliminates* the need for Altcoins; and eliminates also the narrative(s) that allow scammers to peddle them.

If anything, DC would move Altcoins *off* of L1 Bitcoin, onto their own L2 sidechain. 



### 2. BIP300 will *CHANGE* Bitcoin into something else 🤡

No -- Bip300 **only** affects the people who use it.

Your existing node, will still do EXACTLY what it was doing before. It will NOT *start* doing anything new; it will NOT *stop* doing anything it was doing before. This is the magic of the [*soft fork*](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=945977.0). This is a side-deal between consenting users and miners -- not you.



### 3. Miners Can Steal From BIP300 Sidechains 🤡

Miners can [steal from the Lightning Network, more easily](https://x.com/Truthcoin/status/1701959339508965405?s=20) than they can from DC.

In reality, [miners will not be stealing from DC](https://www.drivechain.info/blog/fees/), nor from LN.

"Miners" control the L1 chain, and everything that goes into it -- if you are against miners, you are against Proof-of-Work and against Bitcoin.

If this type of thing bothers you, then don't use Bip300. [Don't run a Bip300 node](https://x.com/Truthcoin/status/1707423956876005556?s=20) either. Trust me, we won't miss you.



### 4. Drivechain Changes Miners' Incentives: 🤡

Drivechain allows miners to collect 10,000x more revenues (or more).

In return, they are encouraged to (but never required to):

1. ...activate/deactivate sidechains, in order to maximize BTC's price & maximize total txn fees.
2. ...investigate the status of a disputed withdrawal (of which there can only be one per 3 months).

This is precisely [what Satoshi intended](https://www.truthcoin.info/blog/security-budget-ii-mm/#c-its-too-late--mm-is-already-widespread) for miners. Merged mining was invented by Satoshi, and has been in continuous use ever since. I've merely optimized it.

For more see [here](https://x.com/Truthcoin/status/1704643105171935619?s=20).


### 5. Altcoins are only for Scamming, Never for Innovation! Don't you know?? 🤡

Most Alts are scams -- especially the famous ones.

But many Alts were created by diehard Bitcoiners, out of exasperation:

* Vitalik Buterin was [the first co-founder of Bitcoin Magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalik_Buterin#Bitcoin_Magazine). He wrote [100% about Bitcoin](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/authors/vitalik-buterin) for years -- I personally recall him living out of a tent because he was paid only a tiny amount. His concept [of Turing Complete script](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=428589.0) was [met with contempt by the Bitcoin community](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=431513.0), [including me](https://www.truthcoin.info/blog/contracts-oracles-sidechains/). It could not possibly have been brought to Bitcoin (not without Bip300). So instead he did a heavily pre-mined Altcoin. It was shady at the time, and still is. Nonetheless, today it has [more paying customers than BTC](cryptofees.info).
* Roger Ver poured his time, money, heart, and soul into Bitcoin. He and other largeblockers tried for years to achieve a LargeBlock Bitcoin, but failed. Again, this left them with no other choice but to join with BCH when Amaury created it in 2017.
* Riccardo Spagni, cultural leader behind Monero, gave a 2 hour long interview on [Bitcoin Uncensored](https://www.resistance.money/bu/). During it he was adamant that he did not want to create an Altcoin, but what could he do instead? He wanted additional privacy via ring signatures. Ultimately, we all agreed that there was nothing else he could have done. After all there was no Bip300 at the time.
* Jeremy Rand, leader of the Namecoin project, [wrote explicitly](https://forums.whonix.org/t/namecoin-integration-in-whonix/11498/3) on why he could do Namecoin on Bitcoin: "no one has figured out how to make it work"
* David Vorick, creator of Sia, [wrote explicitly](https://sia.tech/sia.pdf): "Sia will initially be implemented as a blockchain-based altcoin. Future support for a two-way peg with Bitcoin is planned".
* I myself wished to do a sidechain with my Truthcoin project (now [Bitcoin Hivemind](https://bitcoinhivemind.com/)). I build Altcoin software for testing, but never launched an actual Altcoin (instead, I worked on Bip300).

Plus countless more.

Even if all Alts were scams, it doesn't mean every new blockchain design will be. It's too risky to put all our eggs in one basket! We need *competition* among chain designs.


### 6. Drivechain is funded by VCs! 🤡

We have received $0 from VCs. Funding for LayerTwo Labs comes from Bitcoin OGs with 10+ years experience. Our investors understand Bitcoin much better than you do. Plus, Paul's business model for L2L, does NOT rely on Bip300 being activated in BTC.

Drivechain was proposed [back in 2015](https://www.truthcoin.info/blog/drivechain/). L2L was only funded at the end of 2022. 

All of this is irrelevant ad hominem anyway. Drivechain is good for Bitcoin and is [widely supported by the independent technical elite](layertwolabs.com/friends).


### 7. Why are people rushing this??? 🤡

It isn't rushed at all. It is 8 years old.

Read the [literature page](https://www.drivechain.info/literature/) to see just how slowly things have gone, overall.

People are pushing Drivechain in late 2023, because the 2021-2023 BS narratives (S2F, LN, institutions) are collapsing and they want something new. 


### 8. Isn't Bitcoin already Perfect?! Why rain on our parade? Thinking is for nerds!! 🤡

Bitcoin is not perfect. Consider the following:

* History is replete with examples, of a Great Power growing overconfident... and then falling. The [Fall of Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire) and [sinking of the "unsinkable" Titanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic) are famous historical examples; the [Enron Scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron_scandal) and [Star Wars Prequels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxf1c3fzDOU) are modern examples.
* Why did banknotes replace gold? After all, gold is the harder money. One reason: that tech / culture changed, to prioritize long distance trade. If it happened to gold, it can happen to BTC. Especially if the users are all moving to "custodial lightning" (aka fiat) -- see [here](https://x.com/TuurDemeester/status/1398371950980964353?s=20) [here](https://x.com/callebtc/status/1628331299562786816?s=20) 
* It is easy to accidentally join a cult -- see [Behind the Curve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvzgaHCnwqo) and [Going Clear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixgd38EZIR0) and compare to [this (2:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSF8nbmj2As) [this](https://x.com/TheBlueMatt/status/1556448996159377414?s=20) and [this](https://x.com/CobraBitcoin/status/1110315791910617089?s=20).
* Lightning is the supposed savior of Bitcoin, according to the othodoxy. But the knowledgeable Lightning Insiders have been jumping ship all last year -- see [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjFjK-f9ts0) [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnG5H62I7Ko) [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCWTTY1eDoo) [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EocWax43QgQ) and [this](https://www.truthcoin.info/blog/lightning-limitations/).
