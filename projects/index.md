## Intent Declared

Here is an exciting list of projects which plan to take advantage of sidechain technology.

### 1. Bitcoin Extended

A heavier, less decentralized chain for higher-throughput, cheaper Bitcoin transactions. Aims for simplicity and modularity; Bitcoin Core + BIP 101.

### 2. Hivemind

P2P Oracle System and Digital Marketplace. This project aims to revolutionize the way information is created and diffuses through society. As a side-effect, it creates efficiencies in capital markets, destroys scams, and creates certain types of digital insurance markets.

### 3. MimbleWimble

Forged in the Chamber of Secrets by the Dark Lord himself, this hyper-specialized transaction system is far less programmable than Bitcoin, but features a 'magically' shrinking blockchain.

### 4. Rootstock

A reimplementation of Ethereum, led by Bitcoin veteran and world-class security researcher Sergio Demian Learner. Has less self-deception than Ethereum, and less dream-selling, but has more "actual work" and professional ethics.

### 5. The Elements Project

Blockstream's Labratory. Where extremely technical (and highly ambitious) features are tested before they make their way to Bitcoin Core.

### 6. SiaCoin

A P2P Dropbox. Matches users who want to back up files, to users with unused hard drive space. Sortof an "AirBnB" of hard drive space.

### 7. Bitcoin Codex

A re-design of Namecoin as a sidechain. Has the potential to greately improve internet safety, privacy, and reliability.

## Unintentional Sidechains

These are great projects, whose codebase we might use as a sidechain of Bitcoin.

### 8. Monero

Uses ring signatures for greater transaction privacy, at the chain level.

### 9. Zcash

This project uses zk-snarks for extreme privacy. In fact it's so private that no one really understands what's going on in here.

### 10. Original Ripple

[Link.](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=297287.0)

Original Ripple allowed users to extend credit to their friends, and for that credit to then be extended to friends-of-friends in a big trust network.


### 11. BitMessage

A P2P message system emphasizing privacy. With BTC fees, we might have a solution to the problem of e-mail spam. We could then break Google's hold over our entire communications infrastructure (and password-reset infrastructure). Perhaps even LinkedIn and even Facebook would end up disrupted.

Edit: I think this particular use would [not require drivechain per se](https://twitter.com/Truthcoin/status/935670042141908993).

### 12. Counterparty

Digital asset market, with P2P trades. These assets are usually for games, or collectables, but they *may* also be backed by TTPs to enable ‘stocks on the blockchain’, 'gold on the blockchain', 'airline miles'.

### 13. DropZone

Physical contraband market. Currently the production version uses Bitcoin Testnet for messages. A sidechain might be more stable, and might allow for the system to automatically confirm that BTC payments have taken place.

### 14. CommerceBlock

Building higly customised sidechains called Ocean.  Using MainStay to secure sidechains on the Bitcoin BlockChain.
